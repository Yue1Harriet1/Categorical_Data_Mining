Multiple Correspondence Analysis

# 1. Optimal Scaling:
- * Assign scales to the levels of categorical variables *
- * The projections of the vertices onto the 1st principal axis provide the optimal scaling *
- The scale of the levels of the 1st variable is optimal in terms of distinguishing between the behavior of the levels of the 2nd variable in association to the 1st
- The projections of the profile points onto the 1st principal axis provide the score of the profile
- Assumptions: avg of optimal scaling = 0 ; variance = 1
- Transformation of Optimal scaling: to fix 2 end-points (0=disagree, 100=strongly agree)
